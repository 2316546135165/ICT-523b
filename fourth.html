<h1>Survey results</h1>
<p>The survey results show that the majority of customers are women, accounting for the largest proportion between the ages of 18 and 25, up to 50 percent, and half of the customers' income is between 2000 yuan and 4000 yuan. The customers' awareness of the brand is general. Most customers buy products mainly through the network. The company's main development direction is in expanding sales. The customer's feedback is mainly that the price is too high, and customers generally want high-quality and inexpensive products
The expectation of our company is to have more open sales platforms, because customers generally think it is inconvenient to buy our products
Our company's trading platform design is not simple enough and often lags behind</p>
